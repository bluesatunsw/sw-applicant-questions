# Rules

As stated in [CHALLENGE.md](CHALLENGE.md):
- Use Text (Arduino C++) mode only. Block-based programming is not allowed.
- Avoid start-to-finish tutorial projects. We want to see how you learn and reason. It is also straightforward for us to identify solutions that closely match public guides.

## General Rules

1. **No plagiarism!** - If cheating is detected, you simply will not get an interview and you will not be considered in future terms.

2. **Be tidy** - We pay attention to your code, comments, usage of Git and anything else that is relevant.

3. **Commit per iteration** - It helps markers see your progress (e.g., a refactor or optimization can be shown as a separate commit).

4. **Don't panic!** - We assess your submission based on your expected ability level. If you are early in your degree and/or have no relevant experience, don't worry as we will take this in mind (as long as you tell us on your application form, anyway!).

5. **Make sure you understand why your solution works!** - submitting this task with care will get you an interview, but we assess you primarily on your ability to explain it!

6. **Not an assignment** - If you can't meet the goals of the challenge or cannot get it working, submit your best attempt instead. This still can show us a lot about your abilities!

7. **Research is a skill!** - If you needed to learn things to get this working, make sure you let us know somehow.

8. **Beware AI** - It is a very bad idea to use ChatGPT for anything other than learning languages or getting pointers on what to do - AI-generated code is easy to spot and will be judged much more harshly. Also remember that it is very poor at abstract problem solving and sometimes will just lie to you about code problems.
