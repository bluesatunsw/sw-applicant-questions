# Rules template

Add rules for challenge here! These should be things like "You may use the following languages" or similar. **Don't put the problem specification here - put that in CHALLENGE.md and leave this doc for rules about how code is written / how they may research things**.


# General rules

1. **No plaigarism!** - If cheating is detected, you simply will not get an interview and you will not be considered in future terms.

2. **Be tidy** - We pay attention to your code, comments, usage of Git and anything else that is relevant.

3. **Consider committing per iteration!** - It's helpful to markers if we can see the path you took to achieve a goal set by the task - e.g. for optimisation, you may restructure to change datastructures - this is best to put in a new commit so we can see the progress.

4. **Don't panic!** - We assess your submission based on your expected ability level. If you are early in your degree and/or have no relevant experience, don't worry as we will take this in mind (as long as you tell us on your application form, anyway!).

5. **Make sure you understand why your solution works!** - submitting this task with care will get you an interview, but we assess you primarily on your ability to explain it!

6. **Not an assignment** - If you can't meet the goals of the challenge or cannot get it working, submit your best attempt instead. This still can show us a lot about your abilities!

7. **Research is a skill!** - If you needed to learn things to get this working, make sure you let us know somehow.

8. **Beware AI** - It is a very bad idea to use ChatGPT for anything other than learning languages or getting pointers on what to do - AI-generated code is easy to spot and will be judged much more harshly. Also remember that it is very poor at abstract problem solving and sometimes will just lie to you about code problems.
