## How to use this repository

We have a selection of questions available as branches of this repository. They are the branches prefixed with `QUESTION_x` where `x` is the problem title. **To make your attempt, please do EXACTLY the following:**

1. Create a **fork** of this repository by clicking "Fork" on the GitHub page.
2. Git clone your fork - `git clone [http/ssh link] [folder name (optional)]`
3. Check out to the question you want to try - `git checkout QUESTION_x`
4. Make your attempt! Be sure to follow the rules as specified in the `RULES.md` file in that branch!
5. Once complete, make sure you have at least one valid commit (preferably multiple if you do iterations!) including all your files and push. If you aren't confident with Git, just do the following commands:
    a. `git add -A` - add all files to commit
    b. `git commit -m [message]` - create a commit with a description
    c. `git push -u origin [name of your branch]`
    NOTE: this is the bare minimum! We will notice if you use Git better :)
6. Follow any other instructions per your application form.

Disclaimer: make sure you do the above correctly BEFORE interview details are released! If you aren't sure, please ask for help as directed under the "Need help?" heading.

2. (more to come with following terms!)

WARNING: only the above problems are valid! If you find another branch which is not listed above, it is a work in progress or retired and **we will not assess submissions to them+**
